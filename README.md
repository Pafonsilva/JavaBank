# JavaBank
The javabank project

Here are all the steps we took in class to make the java Bank, a bank application that uses java, maven, spring, MySql, CSS and HTML to create something simmilar to a homebanking app with all user information saved on a database,
with options to tranfer money around and to open new users and accounts.
